Perlin Noise: Often used to create natural-looking textures like terrain, clouds, and other organic shapes. It produces smooth, continuous patterns, and is frequently used in games for terrain generation and texture mapping.

Simplex Noise: A variant of Perlin noise that can create smoother, more complex textures.

Fractals: Used for generating recursive, self-similar shapes and textures. Examples include the Mandelbrot set, which can be used for terrain or abstract patterns.

L-systems (Lindenmayer Systems): A formal grammar used to model the growth processes of plants, trees, and fractal-like structures.

Voronoi Diagrams: Used to divide space into regions based on distance from a set of points. These can be used to generate textures, map layouts, or even simulate things like natural phenomena (e.g., cell growth or cracks in a surface).
